## Credits
This was forked from the repo by Brandon Claasenbrood`: https://github.com/BJCaasenbrood/ThesisDotTex and he in turn also credits others:
'Major credits to (ex) PhD candidates (and thus doctors by now): dr. Bart Besselink, dr. Benjamin Biemond, and dr. Mark Rijnen for their contribution to the template! 99.9% of the credits should go to these guys, I'm merely the guy who decided to add in some new features and put the thing on git.'

## Clean-up using Python
If you have python installed, you can run the `cleanup.py` to clear all the redundant .aux, .mklatex, ect. files. In your system's terminal, run

```python
# standard
python cleanup.py

# or using Python3
python3 cleanup.py
```
